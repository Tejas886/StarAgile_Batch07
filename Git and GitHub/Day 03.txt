=> GIT RESTORE
If you want to recover a deleted file we will use git restore command
Note: You should know which file was deleted

Scenario 1: Deleted but not staged

Scenario 2: Deleted and Staged for Commit

Scenario 3: Deleted, Staged and Committed

Scenario 4: If you dont know the file name


=> GIT STASH
10.00 AM ----> TL ----> Assigned a task ----> Create file and write some code -----> 10.10 you started working on the task......Task is still going on
	When the work is still going on, will you add the file to the staging area? NOOOO
	When the work is still going on, will you commit the file? NOOOO
	Partially completed task shouldn't be added and committed.
	To proceed with new task we will add the current task to an area which is known as STASHING AREA
	Stash is a place where we can temporarily store the partially completed task

11.30 AM ----> TL ----> Dont do the current task, there is a new task (create a file) which is of immediate priority. First complete the new task and then go to your previous task

Before stashing the content in file is
This is a sample stash file
This file is having java code
This file is written by

Once the file is stashed, you will not see any content
And if we do "git status" working tree is clean

git stash apply
git stash list
git stash apply <StashID>

=> GitHub
GitHub is the place where we store the source code of the application.
To work with GitHub we need to signup to GitHub
GitHub account is completely free
GitHub supports 2 GB of storage for Free tier accounts

=> Signup to GitHub 

=> In GitHub we can create repositories.
Generally we have 2 types of repos;
	1. Public repo		--- which can accessed by anyone, even without a GitHub account
	2. Private repo	--- which is accessible only to you

=> Creation of Repo.

Every repo. will have an unique repo URL
The use of the URL is to access the repo from local to remote and remote to local
https://github.com/Rajan-Kumar-01/public-repo-demo.git

=> Get the code available in remote repo to local
git clone <Repo URL>
Whenever we clone a remote repo, a .git folder will be available by default
By default when we create a GitHub repo, a branch gets created which is known as "main"
When we clone the remote repo to local, the main branch will be visible at the end of the command terminal

Create a file in local
Add and Commit
git push -u origin main
it will show failed to connect. Because we have to configure with PAT



=> Send the code from local to remote

=> Make the changes in remote directly (create a file) and observe the changes in local
GIT PULL - git pull will pull only the changes that are available in the remote repo

=> 2 developers are working
	dev1 - local system --- git pull (10.00 AM) --- starts a creating a new file --- add and commit --- (10.30 AM) tries to push the code to remote from local
	dev2 - remote repo --- created a file in remote (10.20 AM)

=> FORKING A REPO
If you want to get the repo from one GitHub account to another GitHub account, then we can do fork
When we do fork automatically the changes made by owner will automatically sync to your repo
